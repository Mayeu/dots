1.) Welcome to i3!

This message provides an overview of the default keybindings to use i3.
Please also make sure to have a look at the man page and the user's guide:
http://i3.zekjur.net/docs/userguide.html


2.) Configuration Files

/etc/i3/config is the default configuration. It is recommended to copy it and
afterwards edit it to suit your needs (in particular, you may want to disable
this message):

	cp /etc/i3/config ~/.i3/config


3.) Keybindings

The following explanation is related to the QWERTY layout, but as the default
configuration uses keycodes instead of keysymbols for binding, you still have
to press the same physical keys, regardless of your keyboard layout.

The Mod1 key is usually bound to the "Alt" key on your keyboard.

Mod1+Enter opens a terminal emulator
Mod1+v starts dmenu (an application launcher)

The directional keys are j(left), k(down), l(up) and ;(right). You can also use
the arrow keys on your keyboard, if you prefer them.

Mod1+<directional key> moves the focus to the window in the given direction
Mod1+Shift+<directional key> moves the window to the given direction
Mod1+<number> opens the corresponding workspace
Mod1+Shift+<number> moves a window to the selected workspace
Mod1+h sets the mode of a container to stacking
Mod1+e sets the mode back to default
Mod1+f toggles fullscreen mode for the current window
Mod1+Shift+Space toggles floating mode for the current window
Mod1+Shift+q closes a window
Mod1+Shift+r restarts i3 in-place (at this time, you will lose your layout)
Mod1+Shift+e exits i3

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!
Have fun using i3
